# PALO-ALTO-LAB-CONTENT-ID-ANTIVIRUS
Content-Id is one the main 3 pillars in the palo alto firewall along with App-Id and User-Id. Here the palo alto firewall inspects the packet at the application level and decrypts the data(if the decryption policy is present) and figure out if the user is trying to download some malware or virus into their device. Here we have configured Antivirus.
